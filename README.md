# Lition Maker V1.0

Synechron's Lition Maker is a tool that allows users to create and manage Lition network. Manually editing configuration files and creating nodes is a slow and error-prone process. Lition Maker can create any number of nodes of various configurations dynamically with reduced user input. This provides a wizard-like interface with a series of questions to guide the user when creating nodes. Lition Maker can create nodes to:

- run with docker-compose (BFT consensus/Lition 1.0.0) for easy use in development environments; or,
- nodes to be distributed on separate Linux boxes or cloud instances for a production environment (BFT consensus/Lition 1.0.0)
